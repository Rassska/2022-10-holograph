## ü§î Areas Of Concern

1. Bridging NFTs
  - Can bridge tokens be sent out to a secondary network?
  - Can bridge tokens be received on the secondary network?
  - Can someone bridge an NFT while not being the owner of the NFT?
  - Can a payload be constructed to exploit or spoof a bridge request?
2. Jobs
  - Can a bridge job be created to manually select an operator?
  - Can a bridge job be created to manually select a pod?
  - Can a bridge job be completed by the primary operator?
  - Can a bridge job be completed by a secondary operator, if the primary operator has not completed the job?
  - Can a bridge job be completed by ANYONE after primary and secondary operators fail to complete a job?
  - Are job operators who fail to complete jobs slashed correctly?
3. Operator
  - Can an operator bond to a pod?
  - Can an operator bond to a pod that does not exist?
  - Can an operator join a pod without bonding?
  - Are the bond amounts computed correct?
  - Can the bond amount be exploited? spoofed?
  - Are operators
  - Can an operator remove their bond?
  - Can an operator remove their bond after being slashed?
